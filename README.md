Wow! Here we are at my second HTML/Javascript project – a palindrome checker!

Here is the link: https://learnmore-smart.github.io/Palindrome-checker/

Wait a sec… What is a palindrome? It’s a word that reads the same way forwards and backwards (e.g., dad, mom, madam).

It was pretty simple; however, adding a small feature like the “Enter” button took me a bit of time!

Let’s test your vocabulary!

Enjoy~
